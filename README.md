## Skin Cancer Detection

![Skin Cancer Detection](images/skin_cancer_detection.png)

This project aims to develop a skin cancer detection system using machine learning techniques. Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection plays a crucial role in successful treatment. With the increasing availability of digital images and advancements in computer vision, it is possible to create an automated system that can assist dermatologists in detecting skin cancer.

### Features

- **Image Classification**: The system can classify skin lesions into different categories, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves high accuracy in skin cancer classification, helping in early detection and reducing the number of false positives.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing skin lesion images.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualizations and heatmaps are generated to highlight areas of interest and aid dermatologists in their analysis.
- **Fast Inference**: The model's architecture is optimized for quick inference, enabling efficient processing of images in real-time.
- **Open-Source**: The project is open-source, allowing other researchers and developers to contribute, improve, and utilize the skin cancer detection system.

### Technology Stack

- **Python**: The project is primarily developed using the Python programming language.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, is used for building and training the skin cancer detection model.
- **OpenCV**: OpenCV is used for image preprocessing and manipulation tasks.
- **Flask**: Flask, a web framework in Python, is utilized to create the user interface and handle image uploads.
- **HTML/CSS**: HTML and CSS are used to design and structure the user interface of the web application.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-cancer-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights and place them in the `models` directory.

4. Start the application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the skin cancer detection system.

### Usage

1. Open the skin cancer detection system in your web browser.

2. Click on the "Upload Image" button and select an image of a skin lesion from your local machine.

3. Wait for the system to analyze the image and provide the classification result.

4. Explore the visualizations and heatmaps to gain insights into the model's decision-making process.
